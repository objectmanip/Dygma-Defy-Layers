Added the files for each layer.

# Layer 1: Colemak
Colemak Mod DH layer with num row/F-keys and media keys.
The Ctrl+Alt+Shift on the innermost thumb key is for my program switching macro, e.g. Ctrl+Alt+Shift+O would open or switch to ObsidianMD.

Changes to previous version: 
- *Ctrl* and *Shift* are now dual function keys with *right* and *left* respectively
- changed the left arrow keys to *up/down* from *left/right*
- replaced the right arrow keys with 
- Changed the super copy to *-*
- Added dual *backspace/altGr* to the right thumb cluster

# Layer 2: Numpad & Mouse Movement
Mostly used for the numpad, as I don't use the numrow on top for comfort reasons.

Changes to previous version:
- removed the arrow keys below the mouse navigation due to layer 7 and the dual function arrow keys on layer 1

# Layer 3: Symbols
Symbol layer with mirrored layout for the different brackets (open on the left, close on the right) and all necessary symbols.

# Layer 4: Gaming 1
Gaming layer 1 which is based on the colemak base layer, except that some of the superkeys and dualkeys are removed to reduce keypress latency.
- Option to move to layer, that has the right side mapped to the same fingers on the left side
- Option to move to layer with numpad on left side

Left handed layers remove the need to move from mouse to keyboard and provides all the keys for hotkeys.

# Layer 5: Gaming 2 Mirrored right side onto left side
Having the right side mapped on the left side (with the same fingers pressing each key, so the layout is mirrored) helped with muscle memory.

# Layer 6: Gaming 3 Left handed numpad

# Layer 8: CAD
Currently only transparent, so nothing to show here

# Layer 10: Layer Lock
Gateway to all necessary layers, when the layer switcher is not available.
